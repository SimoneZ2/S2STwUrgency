    <h1>Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Translation with
        Urgency Preservation in Time-Sensitive Scenarios</h1>

    <section class="abstract">
        In a global society where collaboration increasingly involves speakers of different
        languages, communication barriers remain a significant challenge. The problem
        becomes particularly relevant in urgent scenarios, where critical information must
        be delivered rapidly and understood correctly across speakers of different lan-
        guages. To address this challenging issue, we introduce a multilingual framework
        for near real-time speech-to-speech translation that explicitly detects and pre-
        serves urgency. The system extends the cascade paradigm by integrating audio-
        and text-based urgency recognition with urgency-aware speech synthesis, and has
        been implemented as an open-source prototype accessible through WebRTC. As
        a complementary contribution, we created the first multilingual dataset explicitly
        annotated for urgency, comprising 200 recordings in English, French, German,
        Dutch, and Italian. The framework has been evaluated through both quanti-
        tative and qualitative analyses. Quantitatively, the system achieves an average
        end-to-end latency below three seconds, a Word Error Rate (WER) of 8.28% for
        non-urgent audios and 10.30% for urgent audios, BLEU scores of 0.40 and 0.33
        respectively, and full consistency across repeated trials. Qualitatively, human
        evaluators rated translation quality with a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.69
        for non-urgent audios and 3.38 for urgent ones, and urgency preservation with
        a MOS of 3.34, confirming that the intended tone was reliably perceived. These
        results indicate that the system achieves real-time performance while maintain-
        ing translation accuracy and effectively preserving urgency. While most current
        solutions are offered by commercial providers and deployed on the cloud, raising
        significant privacy concerns, our system is released open-source and can be exe-
        cuted on premises using a mid-range server
